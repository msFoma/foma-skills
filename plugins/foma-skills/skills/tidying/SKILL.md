Finds unneeded files, shows a manifest, and removes only what the user approves, in a way that can be undone. Report first, nothing changes before the ok.

## Steps
1. Read the CLAUDE.md contract (`## Where things live`: Docs, Plans, Scratch, Trash). Not a git repo: say so and stop (nothing is recoverable). `$ARGUMENTS` only narrows the path.
2. Detect without reading file contents: `git status --short -uall`, `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, `git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard --directory`, `find` for zero-byte files and empty dirs (skip `.git`, `node_modules`, venvs, build output).
3. Sort every candidate into a tier. **T1** safe to remove: OS junk, backup and merge leftovers, Claude temp, zero-byte strays, empty dirs. **T2** needs a look: untracked scratch or debug scripts, `.md` outside the docs home, logs, screenshots, large untracked files, finished plans (archived, never deleted). **T3** never touched: `.env*`, keys, data, assets, untracked source that matches no T1 pattern, `.git`, nested repos.
4. A T2 item is only listed when it has a second signal: no `grep -r` reference to its name, or an untracked file older than the last commit. A detector (knip, vulture, cargo-machete) counts as one signal only if the project already has it; never install one.
5. Show the manifest, grouped by tier and by kind: path, size, tracked or untracked, why. Show T3 as a count only. Compact: more than 30 items per group → counts plus the first 10 and the path of the full list in `.claude/.scratch/tidy.md`.
6. Ask per group (T1 groups first; T2 one item at a time unless the user takes the group). Remove only approved groups.
   - Tracked: `git rm` (history keeps it).
   - Untracked: `mv` into `.trash/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/` keeping the relative path, and append `path<TAB>git HEAD sha` to `.trash/<stamp>/MANIFEST`.
   - Finished plans: move to `docs/plans/archive/`.
7. Verify: re-run the detection for removed paths, confirm each is gone and each trashed file is in `.trash/`; if the project has a test command, run it once. Report what was undone-able how.
8. Prevention: a junk kind seen twice, or a missing `.gitignore` entry for `.trash/` and `.claude/.scratch/`: propose the pattern; edit `.gitignore` only after its own ok. Bigger rules go to `/foma-skills:learning`.

## Rules
- Never `rm -rf`, `git clean`, `find -delete` or any delete that git or `.trash/` cannot restore.
- Never touch T3, a path outside the project, or anything you were not shown and approved.
- A file is not junk because its name looks odd: unclear means T2, never T1.
- Empty `.trash/` only when the user asks, and name what it holds first.
- Not a decision of yours: tracked source, tests and docs. Unused code is a finding for `/foma-skills:refactoring`, not a removal here.

If you sort candidates into tiers (step 3), read `references/tiers.md` for the patterns.

## Report
- Per group: found, removed, left (and why); trash folder.
- Undo: `mv` back from `.trash/<stamp>/` (MANIFEST has the paths), `git restore` for tracked.
- Not checked: <...>

Next: `/foma-skills:learning` if a junk kind keeps coming back.
